Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 2:

Exploratory Data Analysis
Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.Performed EDA on a dataset using Python to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers. Utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning and visualization.

**dataset:**The dataset used for this task is "test.csv".This dataset contains data on the passengers of the Titanic, including:
Survival status
Passenger class
Name, sex, and age
Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket fare
Cabin and embarkation port

ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries Used:**
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn

Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Dropped or imputed incomplete records.
Converted categorical variables into numerical ones for analysis.

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis:
Analyzed distributions of key features (Age, Fare, Sex, Pclass).
Explored survival rates across different groups (e.g., male vs female, class-wise).

Visualization:
Created bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and heatmaps.
Highlighted survival trends based on passenger characteristics.
